Smart Traffic Management System – Team Udbhav
Overview

Urban traffic congestion causes delays, fuel wastage, and frustration. Fixed-timing signals cannot adapt to real-time traffic, leading to longer queues on busy roads.

Our AI-based Smart Traffic Management System uses real-time data from cameras and IoT sensors to dynamically optimize signal timings. Busy lanes get more green time, empty lanes wait less, ensuring smoother traffic flow and reducing commute time by at least 10%.
